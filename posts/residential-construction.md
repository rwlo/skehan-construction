Brendan Skehan was great!  He installed a dishwasher and repaired two toliets in our San Francisco house.  He was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and punctual.  He was also reasonably priced, charging me $360 for 3 hours of work including replacement parts for 2 toliets.  Very pleased!  Thanks fellow yelpers for the referral.
