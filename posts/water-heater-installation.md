title: Water Heater Installation

This review has been long over do.  I live in a two story flat with a two-car garage and needed a washer and dryer installed.  Unfortunately, my side of the garage did not have the water and electrical hook ups and to share the excising hookups of my upstairs neighbors, it would have been a pain in the Ass.  That's because we would have had to split the electricity and the gas bill for the hot water.  We also would have had to use just one washer and dryer between five people.  For me, that's B.S. and I am not going to wait for someone to finish his or her laundry. I'm not in college anymore and I am too old for that SHEET!  So, for my flat, I decided to have a hot water pipe installed, from my furnace, to my brand new washer.  I also needed to install the drainage pipe going out.  If you only knew how difficult that would have been for me to do.

Having friends back home, in Boston, who  are licensed plumbers and general contractors, I knew that I needed someone that knew their shit when doing a project like this and making sure that it's to code.

That's when I came to Yelp, hunting for a licensed plumber.   Also, after living in the Outer Richmond and observing this neighborhood and all the mom and pop start-up business (electricians, plumbers, Key Smith..etc) in this city,  I find a lot of them tend to be cheezy and seem to not have the proper training or doing their time as an apprentice that's required of these trades.

So my fellow Yelpers who are hunting for a Great Plumber, I can't say this enough and am telling you right now, Brendan Skehan kicks A$$ and knows Plumbing.  He's a License Plumber, as well as a License General Contractor and did an awesome job installing the hot water pipe from my furnace and connecting the secondary drainage pipes my upstairs neighbors.  He also re-plastered the sheet rock in my garage and all for a great affordable price.

BTW, here's customer service for you. I needed an electric cord for my new dryer, Brendan ran out, and purchased one for me at an awesome price, a lot cheaper than what I would have paid for at Best Buy. WTF..who does that? :)

Yelpers, don't let the number of reviews fool you.  You may think that just because Brendan only has seven people that used him and has not established credibility. I'm here to tell you that he is a great plumber and is very HONEST and a very hard worker and got my job done in 3 to 4 hours.  There's a reason why all seven yelpers gave him five stars, count me in as the eighth.

With his permission, here is Brendan's Plumbing License number to prove he's legit! Check it out..which is what you should be asking and doing any ways! ;)  Brendan Skehan: Plumber's License #706346.

Thanks Brendan and will def call you again if I ever need you!
